Build from bzr branch
---------------------
 $ ./bootstrap
 $ ./configure

Use `./configure --help' for options. Use `--prefix' to make an install in
your home directory. This is necessary to test python scripts. Example:

 $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/redshift/root

Now, build the files:

 $ make

The main redshift program can be run at this point. To install to the
prefix directory run:

 $ make install

You can now run the python scripts. Example:

 $ PYTHONHOME=$HOME/redshift/root/lib/python2.7/site-packages \
    $HOME/redshift/root/bin/redshift-gtk


Notes
-----
- verbose flag is (currently) only held in redshift.c; thus, write all
  verbose messages there.
