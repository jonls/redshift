.SH NAME
redshift \- Set color temperature of display according to time of day.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B redshift
\fI-l LAT:LON -t DAY:NIGHT \fR[\fIOPTIONS\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B redshift
adjusts the color temperature of your screen according to your
surroundings. This may help your eyes hurt less if you are working in
front of the screen at night.

The color temperature is set according to the position of the sun. A
different color temperature is set during night and daytime. During
twilight and early morning, the color temperature transitions smoothly
from night to daytime temperature to allow your eyes to slowly
adapt.

\fB\-t\fR DAY:NIGHT
Color temperature to set at daytime/night
.PP
The neutral temperature is 6500K. Using this value will not
change the color temperature of the display. Setting the
color temperature to a value higher than this results in
more blue light, and setting a lower value will result in
more red light.

Default values:
.IP
Daytime temperature: 5500K
Night temperature: 3700K

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
Redshift won’t affect the color of your cursor when your graphics driver
is configured to use hardware cursors. Some graphics drivers have an
option to disable hardware cursors in xorg.conf.
