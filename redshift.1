.SH NAME
redshift \- Set color temperature of display according to time of day.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B redshift
\fI[\-l LAT:LON | \-l PROVIDER:OPTIONS] [\-t DAY:NIGHT] \fR[\fIOPTIONS\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B redshift
adjusts the color temperature of your screen according to your
surroundings. This may help your eyes hurt less or reduce the risk for
delayed sleep phase syndrome if you are working in front of the screen
at night.

The color temperature is set according to the position of the sun. A
different color temperature is set during night and daytime. During
twilight and early morning, the color temperature transitions smoothly
from night to daytime temperature to allow your eyes to slowly
adapt over a period of about an hour. At night the color temperature
should be set to match the lamps in your room. This is typically a low
temperature at around 3000K\-4000K (default is 3700K). During the day,
the color temperature should match the light from outside, typically
around 5500K\-6500K (default is 5500K). The light has a higher
temperature on an overcast day.

.TP
\fB\-t\fR DAY:NIGHT
Color temperature to set at daytime/night
.PP
The neutral temperature is 6500K. Using this value will not
change the color temperature of the display. Setting the
color temperature to a value higher than this results in
more blue light, and setting a lower value will result in
more red light.

Default temperature values:
.IP
Daytime: 5500K, night: 3700K
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
A configuration file with the name `redshift.conf' can optionally be
placed in `~/.config/'. The file has standard INI format. General
program options are placed under the `redshift' header, while options
for location providers and adjustment methods are placed under a
header with the name of that provider or method. General options are:
.TP
\fBtemp\-day\fR = integer
Daytime temperature
.TP
\fBtemp\-night\fR = integer
Night temperature
.TP
\fBtransition\fR = 0 or 1
Disable or enable transitions
.TP
\fBbrightness\-day\fR = 0.1\-1.0
Screen brightness at daytime
.TP
\fBbrightness\-night\fR = 0.1\-1.0
Screen brightness at night
.TP
\fBgamma\fR = R:G:B
Gamma adjustment to apply
.TP
\fBpreserve-calibrations\fR = 0 or 1
Disable or enable preservation of currently applied calibrations.
.TP
\fBadjustment\-method\fR = name
Select adjustment method. Options for the adjustment method can be
given under the configuration file heading of the same name.
.TP
\fBlocation\-provider\fR = name
Select location provider. Options for the location provider can be
given under the configuration file heading of the same name.
.PP
Options for location providers and adjustment methods can be found in
the help output of the providers and methods.

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
Redshift won't affect the color of your cursor when your graphics driver
is configured to use hardware cursors. Some graphics drivers have an
option to disable hardware cursors in xorg.conf.
